     AbstractRune as possible to BaseRune and only use AbstractRune internally. - Currently being worked on
10 | Kill the current way energy is being handled to a new RuneRegistry system - Currently being working
-----------------------------

More details
-----------------------------
The move toward BaseRune: BaseRune will handle the most basic functions and logic of all runes (i.e. rune activation and teleportation) and all runes MUST extend rune
						  to be registered as a rune within Runix.

The Killing of the Tiers class and the move to RunixAPI: This is simply to make it easier for addon developers as well as Runix developers to energy values to blocks
